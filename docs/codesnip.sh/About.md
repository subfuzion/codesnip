## Hello there!

I'm Tony Pujals, a software engineer working at Google Cloud since 2018. I'm focused on Node.js and the broader JavaScript ecosystem for full stack development, but I spend quite a bit of time with Go as well.

I created this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-based blog to start sharing code snippets, short quick start guides, and perhaps an occasional essay or deep dive, on topics mostly related to my day-to-day work in an informal format.

I'm on X ([@tonypujals](https://x.com/tonypujals)), so feel free to DM or give me a follow if any of this stuff is interesting to you. If you want to leave a comment, suggest a topic, or ask a question, you can do that on this site's [Discussions](https://github.com/subfuzion/codesnip/discussions/1) page on GitHub.

☕️
