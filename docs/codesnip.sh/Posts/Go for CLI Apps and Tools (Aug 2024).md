# Go for CLI Apps and Tools

Go provides excellent support for compiling programs to small, static executable binaries, usually called tools, utilities, command line interface (CLI) programs, or just commands.

Go also provides the ability to *embed files* into compiled binaries, including templates, scripts, and other resources, that simplify distribution of complete application bundles as a single file.
