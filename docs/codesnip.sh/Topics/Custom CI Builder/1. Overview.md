In this topic, we'll explore building a custom job for running a battery of checks against source code in a pull request branch before it can be merged to the main branch of a GitHub repository.

There are many ways to handle this (for example, with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)), but for this scenario we'll examine how to accomplish this with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build).

There are a number of automated checks we might want passing on a branch before a pull request is ready. Here's a sample checklist:

- [ ] Policy, for example:
	- [ ] CLA (check contributor has signed a contributor license agreement)
	- [ ] License (check that every source file header contains a license)
	- [ ] Copyright (check that every source file header contains a valid copyright)
- [ ] Analysis, for example:
	- [ ] Lint (check code for potential errors and that it conforms to stylistic and programmatic conventions)
	- [ ] Semantic analysis (check for vulnerabilities with a tool like [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)
- [ ] Testing
	- [ ] Build (check that the source that needs to be compiled[^1] successfully builds)
	- [ ] Runtime (check that all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests pass)

We can think of the orchestration of these checks as tasks (steps) in a workflow.[^2]

Google Cloud provides a fully managed orchestration platform for general task execution, called [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows), that runs tasks deployed to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) or [Cloud Run Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions).

But even more conveniently for the continuous integration (CI) of source code in the main branch, Google Cloud already provides specialized, managed service dedicated to automating build workflows, called [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build).  Let's take a closer look.


[^1]: Any source-to-target transformation process. This includes bundling; hermetically sealing; and machine code (like Go), bytecode (like Java), or language-to-language (like TypeScript-to-JavaScript) generation.
[^2]: The term *orchestration* is used because some or all of the steps of a workflow may be executed in parallel or in sequence (required when there are dependencies on previous steps). A successful workflow is one in which all of the individual steps have finished processing successfully.
