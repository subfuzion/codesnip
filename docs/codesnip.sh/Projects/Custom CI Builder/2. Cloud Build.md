A common use case for Cloud Build is to build a container image from source code. This container image is then used to deploy containers on Google Cloud (for example, as Cloud Run services).

Cloud Build is able to build typical application services using [buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/), an open source technology for detecting the programming language of the source code and building it so a container image can be generated to be made available in [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) for runtime deployment.

Often, this is all that's needed, but to perform all the checks we want to run, we'll need to customize the default build workflow.

There are three options, in order of increasing complexity, available to us:

1. Customize the [build configuration](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration) steps
2. Create a custom [builder](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/use-community-and-custom-builders))
3. Create a [custom buildpack](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/build-run-image)

Knowing that options 2 and 3 are available is reassuring. This gives us a lot of control to tackle just about any conceivable scenario.

However, for our scenario, we don't actually need to [build and deploy containers](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-cloud-run) or do anything else other than to run various tools to perform our checks. The out-of-the-box support for customizing configuration will meet our needs. Let's examine how next.


[^1]: Any source-to-target transformation process. This includes bundling; hermetically sealing; and machine code (like Go), bytecode (like Java), or language-to-language (like TypeScript-to-JavaScript) generation.
[^2]: The term *orchestration* is used because some or all of the steps of a workflow may be executed in parallel or in sequence (required when there are dependencies on previous steps). A successful workflow is one in which all of the individual steps have finished processing successfully.
