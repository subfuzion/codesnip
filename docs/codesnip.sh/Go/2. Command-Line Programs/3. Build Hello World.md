## go build

Using `go run` is convenient during development. This provides quick feedback like the developer experience of Python, Node.js, and other scripting environments that don't have a compilation step. This also helpfully prints the exit code if a program exits with an error.

Once you're ready to build a standalone binary executable for distribution, however, use `go build`.

```
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls -lah hello-world*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 tony  staff   2.1M Aug 25 11:08 hello-world
-rw-r--r--  1 tony  staff   109B Aug 24 14:52 hello-world.go
```

Run the compiled command:

```
$ ./hello-world
Hello, World!
```

If you want to the compiled command to have a specific name, use the `-o` flag:

```
$ go build -o hello hello-world.go
$ ls -lah hello*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 tony  staff   2.1M Aug 25 21:34 hello
-rw-r--r--  1 tony  staff   109B Aug 24 14:52 hello-world.go
```

[^1]: All Go source files must start with a package statement, but executable programs must use `package main`, specifically, and this package can't be imported.

[^2]: The fundamental unit of code reuse in Go is the *package*; this comprises the source files contained within a directory. Only the names of types, variables, constants, and functions that start with a capital letter can be exported for use by other packages. Since no other package can import the main package, there would be no point attempting to export `main` (or anything else).
