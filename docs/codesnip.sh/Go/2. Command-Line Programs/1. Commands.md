Go provides straightforward, first class support for compiling programs to small [^1], static executable binaries [^2], usually just called *commands*.

Go also provides the ability to embed files into compiled binaries [^3], including:

* Templates
* Resources (such as web application assets, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc)
* Scripts (such as data migration and transformation scripts)

This means, for practical intents and purposes, that Go commands are *hermetically sealed and self-contained*, easy to distribute and use on target systems without having to install a language runtime environment, libraries, or other required resources, and without concern for conflicts with dependencies required by other programs on the system.


[^1]:  Small is relative; compiled Go commands will be larger than their compiled C and C++ counterparts because Go links a runtime that includes, among other things, a garbage collector (eliminating a common class of programming bugs).
 
[^2]: Go commands are statically linked, but that doesn't mean they're completely isolated from a host operating system environment. For example, you can't ([without some effort](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo)) target bare metal, but you can target `scratch` containers, which only have a Linux kernel). For specific target architecture/environments, see: https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements.
