# About package main

Executable commands (programs) always begin with `package main`[^1] and they must have an entry point declared as `func main`. [^2]

The following program imports package `fmt` from the standard library, which will be used to print to `stdout` at the terminal.

See: https://pkg.go.dev/fmt


[^1]: All Go source files must start with a package statement, but executable programs must use `package main`, specifically, and this package can't be imported.

[^2]: The fundamental unit of code reuse in Go is the *package*; this comprises the source files contained within a directory. Only the names of types, variables, constants, and functions that start with a capital letter can be exported for use by other packages. Since no other package can import the main package, there would be no point attempting to export `main` (or anything else).
