## Example
###### range-over-args.go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	args := os.Args[1:]

	for i, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(i+1, arg)
	}
}
```

Output

```
$ go run range-over-args.go foo bar
1 foo
2 bar
```


## Explanation

#### Program Arguments

```go
args := os.Args[1:]
```

This code slices the `Args` array to get the arguments starting at index 1 until the end is assigned to the variable `args`. 

The example uses a short assignment statement, a standard Go idiom used in place of a more verbose form or even separate declaration and assignment statements.

So, instead of this:

```go
var args []string
args = os.Args
```

Or this:

```go
var args []string = os.Args
```

Do this instead (idiomatic):

```go
args := os.Args
```

> Note: The short assignment statement can only be used inside of functions.

> The type of `args` will be inferred from `os.Args`, which will be a slice of string elements.
#### Range clause

```go
	for i, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(i+1, ": ", arg)
	}
```

In Go, the range clause is used for iterating over arrays, slices, strings, maps, or channels. 

In this example, the range clause is used to iterate over a slice. When iterating over arrays and slices (a slice is the commonly used abstraction over an array in Go), two values are provided that can be assigned to variables: the index and item at that index.

A common idiom when the index value itself isn't needed, is to use `_` in place of a variable name. This is because Go doesn't allow any declared name to go unused, so `_` provides the ability to indicate this is intentional. For example:

```go
	// ignore the index value
	for _, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(arg)
	}
```
