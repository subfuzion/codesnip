###### range-over-args.go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	args := os.Args[1:]

	for i, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(i+1, arg)
	}
}
```

```
$ go run range-over-args.go foo bar
1 foo
2 bar
```

## Slice

The program takes a slice of the default `Args` slice to skip over the first one at index 0, which is the full pathname of the command. The bracket notation below specifies taking a slice starting at index 1 until the end of `os.Args`. [^1] If there is an element accessible at index 1 of the original slice, `os.Args`, it will now be accessible at index 0 of the new slice, `args`.

```go
args := os.Args[1:]
```

## Short Assignment Statement

The snippet demonstrates a *short assignment statement* [^2], a standard Go idiom used in place of a more verbose form or even separate declaration and assignment statements.

```go
// Instead of this
var args []string
args = os.Args

// Or this
var args []string = os.Args

// Or even this
var args = os.Args

// Use short assignment instead (idiomatic, but only works INSIDE functions)
// Type is automatically inferred
args := os.Args
```

## Looping with the Range Clause

Go has only one looping construct and it's based on the `for` keyword.

In Go, the idiomatic way to loop over types that can be iterated (including standard arrays, slices, strings, maps, and channels) is to use a range clause, as shown In this snippet.

```go
	for i, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(i+1, ": ", arg)
	}
```

For arrays and slices, range yields two values for each element that can be assigned to variables (using short variable declaration syntax): the index and the element at that index.

## Discarding Values

A common idiom when the index value value of the yielded element itself isn't needed is to use `_` in place of a variable name for the assignment. This is because Go doesn't allow any declared name to go unused, so `_` provides the ability to indicate that discarding the value is intentional. 

```go
	// ignore the index value
	for _, arg := range args {
		fmt.Println(arg)
	}
```


[^1]: Slices are very efficient in Go. Internally, a slice is a small struct that points to the underlying array elements while tracking the start, length, and capacity specified by the slice.
[^2]: Also known as *short variable declaration*. Type is automatically inferred. Can only be used inside functions.
