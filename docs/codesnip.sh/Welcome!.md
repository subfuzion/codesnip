Hello, I'm Tony!

I'm a software engineer in Developer Relations Engineering at Google Cloud. This is my personal blog for sharing code snippets, notes, and articles, mostly related to my day-to-day work.

## What's here?

Not a lot just yet. Over the years, I've published content all over the place. As much as I would love to collect everything and aggregate it somewhere, that's not what [CodeSnip](https://codesnip.sh) is for. This is for capturing more of my own day-to-day work-related notes, demos, and code snippets to share with others who might find them useful.

My goal is to keep most things here short and simple. If I think more detail is important, I'll bury it in the footnotes with links for finding more information, but the general idea is that you should be able to breeze through most pages quickly and superficially and only refer to the footnotes if you want to dive deeper.

## About Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a wonderfully productive writing app that I was already using for taking markdown notes. It's blogging support is limited, but it supports my goal to be able to streamline the overhead of formal blogging, capture short notes and code snippets, and share them quickly with a minimal amount of friction to slow me down.

I've used gists for this purpose in the past, but Obsidian provides more structured organization and a very nice markdown editor, is well-supported across all of my devices, and to share, all I need to do is just hit the publish button. This supports my current use case quite well.
