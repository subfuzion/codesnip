Hello, I'm Tony!

I'm a software engineer in Developer Relations Engineering at Google Cloud. This is my new Obsidian-based blog for sharing notes and code snippets.

## Why Obsidian?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a wonderfully productive writing app that I was already using for taking markdown notes. It's blogging support is simple, but it supports my goal to be able to streamline the overhead of formal blogging, capture short notes and code snippets, and share them quickly and with the least amount of friction possible.

I've used gists for this purpose in the past, but Obsidian provides more structured organization and a very nice markdown editor, is well-supported across all of my devices, and to share, all I need to do is just hit the publish button. This supports my current use case quite well.

## What's here?

Not a lot just yet. Over the years, I've published content all over the place. As much as I would love to collect everything and aggregate it somewhere, that's not what [CodeSnip](https://codesnip.sh) is for. This is for capturing more of my own day-to-day work-related notes and code snippets to share with others who might find them useful.

My goal is to keep things short and simple. If I think more detail is important, I'll bury it in the footnotes with links for finding more information. You should be able to breeze through pages quickly and superficially and only refer to the footnotes if you want to know more.

For now, if you'd like to leave me feedback, ask questions, or start a discussion, please do that at [CodeSnip Discussions](https://github.com/subfuzion/codesnip/discussions/1) or on [X](https://x.com/tonypujals).
