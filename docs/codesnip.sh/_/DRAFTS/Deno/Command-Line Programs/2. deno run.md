###### hello-world.ts
```ts
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```
$ deno run hello-world.ts
Hello, World!
```

The obligatory "hello world" program uses the `console` module from the standard library, which in this case simply uses `Println` to print to `stdout` at the terminal. [^1]

[^1]:  The `fmt` package provides a great deal of control in formatting and printing textual output. See: https://pkg.go.dev/fmt.
