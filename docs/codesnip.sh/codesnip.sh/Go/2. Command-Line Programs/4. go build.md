Using `go run` is convenient during development. This provides a convenient developer experience like Python, Node.js, and other scripting environments that don't have a compilation step. This also helpfully prints the exit code if a program exits with an error.

However, once you're ready to build a standalone binary executable for distribution, use `go build`.

```
$ go build hello-world.go
```

By default, this produces an executable command named after the program, minus the `.go` extension on \*nix-based systems or replaced with `.exe` on Windows.

```
$ ls -lh hello-world*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 tony  staff   2.1M Aug 25 11:08 hello-world
-rw-r--r--  1 tony  staff   109B Aug 24 14:52 hello-world.go
```

Run the compiled command:

```
$ ./hello-world
Hello, World!
```

To generate the compiled command with a specific name, use the `-o` flag.

```
$ go build -o hello hello-world.go
$ ls -lah hello*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 tony  staff   2.1M Aug 25 21:34 hello
-rw-r--r--  1 tony  staff   109B Aug 24 14:52 hello-world.go
```
