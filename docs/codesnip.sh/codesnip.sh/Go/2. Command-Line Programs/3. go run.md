###### hello-world.go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {

	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

```
$ go run hello-world.go
Hello, World!
```

The program imports package `fmt` from the standard library, which in this case simply uses `Println` to print to `stdout` at the terminal. [^1]

[^1]:  The `fmt` package provides a great deal of control in formatting and printing textual output. See: https://pkg.go.dev/fmt.
